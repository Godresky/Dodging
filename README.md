# Dodging
I created an arcade game for ScoreSpace Jam #13. I developed the game on Unity 2020.2.3f1.

If you want to run it through Unity, use the 2020.2.3f1 version.

If you want to play the game itself, use the latest version.
You can also download the game from Itch.io.

To play:
- WASD - Move.
- Avoid enemies and their bullets
- Make the enemy bullets fly into the enemies
